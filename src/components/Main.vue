        <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
        <p class="about">I am currently completing my Senior year at Colorado School of Mines pursuing a BS in Computer Science with an emphasis in Data Science. My experience in jobs, education, and general life has consistently involved creativity, motivation, and high spirits. In my free time I work on personal web and mobile app projects, game development, my culinary skills, and getting outdoors whenever I can. Thank you for visiting my website, I hope it gives you a little better of an idea about myself! If you ever wish to contact me, please do not hesitate from using one of the methods above, I would be happy to hear from you to chat about anything.</p>

            <br><br>
            Aside from having an amazing time, gaining a deeper appreciation for the Spanish culture and language, traveling to places all over, and making lifelong friends, I had the incredible honor to collaborate with a group of extremely intelligent computer science students to develop a decentralized, person to person chat application using SOLID, a decentralized web technology under development by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. During that time, I even had the remarkable experience of communicating with Sir Berners-Lee over the SOLID chat room on Gitter. What an incredible experience to place the cherry on top of one of the best times of my life. I cannot wait to travel back to Asturias and see my friends there again.

        <h1 class="experience-title">Experience</h1>
        <p class="experience">It has been an incredible privilege to work for the following companies and collaborate with teams that have helped me grow into the person and professional I am today. I owe it to these coworkers in the same way I owe it to my teachers and professors for giving me the mentorship and guidance to grow and get better at what I love to do.</p>
        <h1 class="work-title">Trimble, Inc. - Westminster, Colorado, US (Remote)</h1>
        <p class="job">Software Engineering Intern (Agriculture Group, GNSS Group)<br>May 2020 - December 2020</p>
        <p class="description">
            Designed and developed the “Vehicle Sync” platform to support collaborative farming among operators in real time using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, Java. Project is a web application served using Android Webview, and I therefore got some experience working in the Android environment and specifically Android Studio.<br>
            Developing GNSS Logging tool to automate diagnosing problems related to in-field satellite disconnects. This project is very similar to what I did with PACCAR, however Trimble's technologies and data storage methods are proprietary, so I am working with minimal documentation. I believe this makes the project a very fun challenge.

            Agile well (I know what you're thinking – I thought we actually did perform Agile fairly well) and employed Azure DevOps to ensure organization and simplicity.

        <h1 class="design-title">Design Work</h1>
        <p class="design">Since I was a kid I have been very interested in design and art of all mediums. I have had the privilege of visiting art museums all over the world, always making a point to do so on my travels, but my favorite of all time 
            is in my hometown, the Seattle Art Museum. The second semester of my junior year at Mines, I was able to take part in a special topics class on the history of art and its relation to the environment. Taking that class further solidified my belief
            in the connection between art, environment, and computer science. The elegance and sentient nature of code exhibits a unique and interpretive beauty that I am personally enraptured in. But I digress, here are some logos that I have created as I explore my
            own abilities in the realm of artwork and design. All of these were done using the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. I also did a lot of the art for the indie games I have developed that are linked at the top of this screen, but I cannot take away credit from my
            incredible teammate and great friend who I worked with on those games and who led the way for a lot of the design, Tyler Zudans.

        <p class="design-description">A logo done for the painting company I worked for while in high school. I still love getting out and doing manual labor of all kinds, my favorite is mowing the lawn.</p>

        <h1 class="projects-title">What Am I Working On Right Now?</h1>
        <p class="projects">Currently, I am finishing the last of my credits in order to complete my undergraduate degree, tutoring students in the evenings, working part time for Trimble, and working on some side projects
            I am very excited about. Without giving away too much, my side projects include a website that serves video and audio content based on a user's preferences and a machine learning tool that transcribes lectures into
            organized notes. Stay tuned for the results of these projects, as they're sure to be linked here. Oh, and of course I am actively searching for full time jobs as I near my graduation date. Wish me luck and know that I'm wishing
            you the same in all of your endeavors! Here's a neat quote for your motivation:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">"If you view all of your problems as opportunities, eventually you'll never have any problems."</p>
        
        <h1 class="quotes-title">What Am I Thinking Right Now?</h1>
        <p class="quote-desc">I thought this simple website might benefit from some JavaScript, so here is a thought generator that will pull a thought (fact) of mine at random. You can kind of think of this as what I am thinking about
            right now. Have fun!
